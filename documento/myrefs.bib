    abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel scale- and rotation-invariant interest point detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features). It approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster.
This is achieved by replying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper presents experimental results on a standard evaluation set, as well as on imagery obtained in the context of a real-life object recognition application. Both show SURF's strong performance.}},

abstract={From May 2 through May 7 of 2008, the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) Exploration Technology Development Program carried out a helicopter field test to assess the use of a flash LIDAR as a primary sensor during lunar landing. The field test data has been used to evaluate the performance of the LIDAR system and of algorithms for LIDAR Hazard Detection and Avoidance, Hazard Relative Navigation, and Passive Optical Terrain Relative Navigation. Reported here is a comprehensive description of the field test hardware, ground infrastructure and trajectory reconstruction methodologies. Â©2010 IEEE.},
