\chapter*{Abstract}


The apperance of RGBD devices, wich means that these are devices that not only do they capture the RGB information they also capture the depth of a pixel, and their availability as a consumer of the shelf device has made possible their incorporation in any robotic autonomous driving demonstrator cheaply. This way a \emph{Kinect} can be taken advantage of as a depth sensor.

Making the robot interact with simple objects, like follow a sphere, or avoid a cilinder or even combining both behaviours , alows the creation of a appealing and interactive demonstrations to sensitize the public to the world of robotics. To make this a reality, taking advantge of these kind of sensors, it becomes necessary to develop software to recognize simple objects in real time in order for them to be used in autonomous robotics demonstrations.

All this work implies a careful scientific review of the existing methods to recognize the said objects and also review the diferent kinds of demonstrators and their purpose. 

It is also necessary to perform a evaluation of the \emph{Kinect}'s precision on evaluating objects placement in the space it detects, and it was found that its precision is very good.

This work confirms the ability to identify complex objects, and it can be done using software libraries and some simple methodologies, from which we can gather rather interesting results using the table as proof of concept to complex objects.
